## IBM Data Science Certificate Applied Capstone Project
* This is the project I completed through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program on Coursera, where I aimed to create a model to predict the outcome of SpaceX   Falcon-9 rocket launches.

### Project Overview
* See the presentation in PDF or PPTX formats in the related files.
* Explore the notebooks where data collection, data cleaning, data processing, data analysis, training of machine learning models, and predictions are coded.
* I created a Plotly dashboard for better data visualizations and deployed it using [Render](https://render.com/). Check it [here](https://ibm-data-science-applied-capstone.onrender.com/).
### Data Details
* The dataset includes launch dates ranging from June 2010 to November 2020, covering 335 Falcon-9 launches during this period.
* The model correctly predicted the outcome of the launch on May 18, 2024. Despite this, given the vast amount of data, it is important to acknowledge that the model's performance may still require improvements.
* The model has an 89% precision for positive cases with a 67% recall.
### Future Work
* The available open-source data provides opportunities for further study and improvements.
* As the domain is relatively new to me, expanding the project to include more data and exploring other classification or regression projects with a broader scope could be thought.
